# Active Calories Predictor
Made using Python and Jupyter notebook

Machine learning model that uses my fitness data, from 01/01/2023 to 11/17/2023 that was recorded using my Apple watch, 
to predict the active calories burned according to what day of the week it is, what my heart rate (max, min, and average) is, and my walking distance/step count.
